/**
 * The handful of build-time facts core needs from whichever app is hosting it.
 *
 * A library module gets its own `BuildConfig`, in its own package, and it carries none of these:
 * `VERSION_NAME`/`VERSION_CODE` do not exist for a library at all, and `TMDB_EDGE_KEY` and
 * `DEV_TOOLS` are the *app's* build inputs. Every one of them is genuinely per-app — the phone app
 * ships its own version and injects its own edge key — so core takes them rather than baking them in.
 *
 * Assigned once from `Application.onCreate`, before anything reads them. It is a settable holder and
 * not a Koin binding on purpose: `CrashRecorder.install()` runs before `startKoin`, and a crash
 * report without a version number is exactly the report that is useless. Same shape as the other
 * two early hooks bound alongside it.
